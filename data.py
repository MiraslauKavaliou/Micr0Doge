(Verizon models except the OG Pixel cannot be unlocked, therefore cannot be rooted) If the option is available then you can go ahead and enable it. After that you need to shut down your device and after it powers off hold the volume down button and power. After that, you will be brought to the bootloader. At this point, you will need to install Platform-tools (you can type !tool and it should be the first link) and plug your device into your computer. Open a terminal/CMD window in the Platform-tools folder and type in fastboot flashing unlock. After that, you will be prompted if you want to unlock your device or not. after it is complete you can reboot your device by choosing the reboot button or typing in the fastboot reboot command on your computer.", color=0xff0000)

In order to create the attestation, the API examines the device's software and hardware environment, looking for integrity issues, and comparing it with the reference data for approved Android devices.
