**Bootloader**

To unlock the bootloader you'll need to go to Settings > About Phone and find your Build number. Tap on it 7 times and you'll see a small text and at the bottom of the screen saying "You're now a developer". After that, you need to go to Settings > Developer Options and find the option that says OEM Unlocking. If it is grayed out then your phone might not be fully paid out or it is a Verizon model. (Verizon models except the OG Pixel cannot be unlocked, therefore cannot be rooted) If the option is available then you can go ahead and enable it. After that you need to shut down your device and after it powers off hold the volume down button and power. After that, you will be brought to the bootloader. At this point, you will need to install Platform-tools (you can type !tool and it should be the first link) and plug your device into your computer. Open a terminal/CMD window in the Platform-tools folder and type in fastboot flashing unlock. After that, you will be prompted if you want to unlock your device or not. after it is complete you can reboot your device by choosing the reboot button or typing in the fastboot reboot command on your computer.

- WARNING: Unlocking the bootloader will wipe your device and erase all information on it. Make sure to back-up your data before doing so. Locking the bootloader back up will mostlikely result in a brick of your device. Never lock the bootloader unless you're 100% stock. -```
